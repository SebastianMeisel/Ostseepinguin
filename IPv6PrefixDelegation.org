* Introduction

Recently my ~ISP~ (Internet Service Provider) finally provided me with modern ~IPv6~. I at least got an ~/60~ prefix, which allows me to do subnetting, with up to 16 subnets, as the network identifier in ~IPv6~ has ~64 bits~. So far so good. But I soon realized, that my prefix changes frequently, just as the ~IPv4~ prefix. That however is a problem. I do have two VLANs, beside my default network, that need their own ~GUA~ (Global Unicast Address) prefix. So whenever my prefix changes I would need to change my VLAN configurations and my routes. That's not feasible.


Gladly there is an solution to that problem: ~IPv6~ Prefix delegation (~PD~).

** How it works

With legacy ~DHCP~ you can automatically provide ~IPv4~ addresses and other configuration information to clients. With modern ~ICMPv6~ you can of cause do the same. But there is more: With ~PD~ you can provide whole network prefixes to a device.

That's actually how you get your ~IPv6~ prefix from your ~ISP~. Your Home router request a Prefix from the ~ISP's~ ~DHCPv6~ server. The ~ISP's DHCP~ server answers with a prefix of a certain length it delegates to your Home router. The good thing now is, that (given your Home router supports ~IA_PD~) you can use an internal router (e. g. a Linux machine) to request itself a portion of this prefix to again provide whole networks e. g.  for VLANs, as in my scenario.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :alt Left: Diagram illustrating IPv6 prefix delegation. The ISP assigns a /60 prefix (3fff:abcd:0:abcd::/60) to a home router. The home router then delegates two /64 prefixes from this /60 block—3fff:abcd:dcbd:abdc::/64 and 3fff:abcd:dcbd:abdd::/64—to two separate downstream devices after receiving individual requests.

The individual Interface of the downstream router can now themself request a ~/64/~ network and an IPv6 address in that network.

** Set up

This is how my network currently looks:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :alt Left: The Internet (as a cloud) is connected to a home router via fiber. From there an Ethernet connection is drawn to a switch, which is connected to a Raspberry Pi, that acts as a router. Above the switch is connected to a Wireless AP, that provides Wifi to various mobile devices in the VLAN "WLAN", which is colored light orange. Beneath a desktop PC is connected to the switch, which is in the VLAN "Office", colored in light purple.

My Home Router gets a ~/60~ IPv6 prefix which changes every few days. To that Home Router I connected a managed switch, so I can have VLANs. The firewall, DHCP(v6) server und router for these VLANs live on a Raspberry Pi, that functions as a router on a stick: It is connected to the switch on a trunk port and has 2 virtual devices for the two VLANs — Office (VLAN Id 10) and WLAN (VLAN Id 20).

My Wifi access point is connect on an access port configured for VLAN 10 on my switch. The Office VLAN so far only contains my desktop Office PC.

** Configuring the Home router

First you have to find out if and where you can enable the DHCPv6 option ~IA_PD~ on your Home router. On my Home router (called Fritz!Box) the menu looks like this an is found under =Home Network → Network → Network Settings → IPv6 Settings=.

** Configuring the Raspberry Pi router
Next we need to configure the internal router. As mentioned I use a Raspberry Pi, but the following steps should work on most modern Linux distributions and any PC hardware. You might prefer a device with more power and more importantly more bandwidth.

I first referred to the [[https://wiki.debian.org/IPv6PrefixDelegation][Debian wiki]] to get an idea on how to do this. I decided to settle on ~systemd-networkd~ to configure my interfaces. I run Raspberry Pi Os, which is based on Debian bookworm. It uses NetworkManager for network management.

~systemd-networkd~ is however installed. So I decided to first configure everything, before disabling ~NetworkManager.service~ and enabling ~systemd-networkd.service~.

*** Configuring the WAN interface

I started with my physical interface, which naturally acts as my WAN-interface:

The first line are the general setup. In the section ~[Match]~ you have to provide the interface name, as setup by the system. Here it is ~eth0~, on other systems it might be something like ~enp0s16f0u1~. Next you have to specify the interface type which is ~ether~ for a wired ethernet link. For a wifi interface it would be ~wlan~. There are other options to match your interface, e. g. the ~MACAddress~.

~/etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network~
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  [Match]
  Name=eth0
  Type=ether
#+END_SRC

Next comes the ~[Network]~ section, starting with a description. You can put anything here.
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  [Network]
  Description=WAN Ethernet port
  #+END_SRC

Now comes the first (slightliy) interesting part. We tell ~networkd~ to use ~DHCPv6~ to get an ~IPv6~ address and — more importantly — to accept ~IPv6~ Router Advertisements (~RA~).

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  DHCP=ipv6
  IPv6AcceptRA=yes
#+END_SRC

In this section we also have to configure which ~VLANs~ we want to associate with this physical interface. 

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  VLAN=Office
  VLAN=WLAN
#+END_SRC

You most likely want to run dual stack. You should use static addressing for the legacy IP address that matches the network your in, e. g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  [Address]
  Address=192.168.178.254
  Gateway=192.168.178.1
#+END_SRC

Don't forget the ~IPv4~ default route. As we use Prefix Delegation for ~IPv6~ you do not need to set any routes there. It is done by ~DHCPv6~ for us.
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
[Route]
Gateway=192.168.178.1
#+END_SRC

So finally there comes the part, where we configure ~IA_PD~ for the WAN interface:

 - PrefixDelegationHint: :: You need to specify the size of the prefix, you want to get. It must be bigger the the prefix you got from your ISP, but at least ~/64~, which would however mean, you can only provide 1 subnet downstream. Normaly it is recommend to observe the nibble boundaries, which means you take steps of 4 bits, so on hex digit stands for one step in your network hierarchy. As I only got a ~/60~ I only have one nibble to work with. I decided that 4 subnets should be enough for now an settled on a ~/62~.[fn:1]
 - UseDelegatedPrefix: :: This option activates the use Prefix Delegation and should be set, although it seems to work with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle files/10-eth0.network
  [DHCPv6]
  PrefixDelegationHint=::/62
  UseDelegatedPrefix=yes
#+END_SRC

*** Configuring the Virtual LAN devices
The next step is to set up the virtual devices for the ~VLANs~. For that we need to create a ~.netdev~ for *each* ~VLAN~ under ~/etc/systemd/network/~. These virtual devices must be created first before the physical device is configured, so the filename should start with ~00-~.

The files need two section:
 - [NetDev]: :: Define a virtual device with a ~Name~ of ~Kind~ ~vlan~.
 - [VLAN]: :: In this section the ~VLAN~ ~Id~ is defined. This must be a number between 1 and 4096. It must match the VLAN Id configured on the managed switch.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/00-vlan10.netdev
[NetDev]
Name=Office
Kind=vlan

[VLAN]
Id=10
#+END_SRC

Lastly a ~.network~ file must be created for *each* ~VLAN~ in the same directory. The number these files start we must be greater than the one the ~.network~ file for the physical starts with. I settled on ~20-~.

It starts with a ~[Match]~ section, just as the ~.network~ file for physical interface. The ~Name~ to match is that configured for the virtual LAN device in the ~.netdev~ file. The ~Type~ must be set to ~vlan~.

If you use physical Interfaces instead, use ~Type~ of ~ether~ or ~wlan~ and skip the ~[VLAN]~ section.
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/20-vlan10.network
  [Match]
  Name=Office
  Type=vlan

  #+END_SRC

The ~[VLAN]~ section with the ~Id~ must be identical to that in ~.netdev~ file.
#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/20-vlan10.network
  [VLAN]
  Id=10

  #+END_SRC

In the ~[Network]~ section is the place where some ~DHCPv6~ option must be configured:
 - DHCP=ipv6: :: We want to use DHCPv6.
 - IPv6SendRA: :: We want to send Router Advertisements, so the devices in the
 - IPv6AcceptRA: :: We also need to accept Router Advertisments from upstream.
 - DHCPPrefixDelegation: :: ~IA_PD~ must also be activated.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/20-vlan10.network
  [Network]
  Description=Office VLAN interface
  DHCP=ipv6
  IPv6SendRA=yes
  IPv6AcceptRA=no
  DHCPPrefixDelegation=yes

#+END_SRC

Again a legacy address should be provided for dual stack.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/20-vlan10.network
  [Address]
  Address=172.16.10.1/24

#+END_SRC

Finally an ~[IPv6PrefixDelegation]~ section is need. You can decide whether you Unique Local (Unicast) Addresses (~ULAs~). It doesn't hurt, although they will not actually be used, as legacy ~IPv4~ is preferred over ~IPv6~ for private addressing.

The second option is more important. With ~SubnetId~ you can configure which of the available subnets you want to use. It's the number of the of the subnet in hexadecimal numbering. So ~0x1~ would be the first ~0xf~ would be the 15th subnets if you have so many to choose from.

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle ./files/20-vlan10.network
  [IPv6PrefixDelegation]
  ULA=true
  SubnetId=0x1

#+END_SRC

*** Disabling NetworkManager and enabling systemd-networkd



** Configure Firewall

* Conclusion



* Footnotes

[fn:1] Each extra bit halves the number of possible subnets. So ~/61~ would give me 8, ~/62~ 4, ~/63~ 2, and ~/64~ 1 possible subnet.
