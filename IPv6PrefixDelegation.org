* Introduction

Recently my ~ISP~ (Internet Service Provider) finally provided me with modern ~IPv6~. I at least got an ~/60~ prefix, which allows me to do subnetting, with up to 16 subnets, as the network identifier in ~IPv6~ has ~64 bits~. So far so good. But I soon realized, that my prefix changes frequently, just as the ~IPv4~ prefix. That however is a problem. I do have two VLANs, beside my default network, that need their own ~GUA~ (Global Unicast Address) prefix. So whenever my prefix changes I would need to change my VLAN configurations and my routes. That's not feasible.


Gladly there is an solution to that problem: IPv6 Prefix delegation (~PD~).

** Set up

This is how my network currently looks:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :alt Left: The Internet (as a cloud) is connected to a home router via fiber. From there an Ethernet connection is drawn to a switch, which is connected to a Raspberry Pi, that acts as a router. Above the switch is connected to a Wireless AP, that provides Wifi to various mobile devices in the VLAN "WLAN", which is colored light orange. Beneath a desktop PC is connected to the switch, which is in the VLAN "Office", colored in light purple.
